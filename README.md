# This project explores various data modelling, classification, and optimization techniques through Python.

# The key project objectives are: #
- Gradient descent algorithm
- Linear regression model with two-dimensional features
- Logistic regression model to perform binary classification
- Image binary classification using training and test sets

# Some Python packages and features that I explored include: #
- Pytorch
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
